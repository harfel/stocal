- add public API documentation
- regroup tests into specifications, unittests and bugs
= release 2.0

OLD TODOs
* stocal.algorithms.AndersonMethod.update_state is broken
+ every argument to StochasticSimulationAlgorithm for sampling interval
+ flexible yield results from StochasticSimulationAlgorithm.__iter__
+ support for proper delay events (-> feature/events)
= release/1.3
- remove dict support in MassAction.reactions and TransitionRule.infer_transitions
- remove invalid-name arguments
- remove AndersonNRM
- remove TrajectorySampler
- remove ReactionRule
- remove Process.trajectory
- allow species equals 0 in initial state?
- move stocal.experimental.CaoMethod into stocal.algorithms
- remove stocal.experimental.samplers
- reorganize stocal/tests/test_examples.py
= release/2.0
- utilities to simplify scipy/matplotlib interaction
- persistency support (save and resume simulations)
- arithmetic operations for Process
- string rewrite rule support
- other kinetic laws, e.g. Hill function
- libSBML integration
- curried reactions (determine products only upon application)
- performance measurements and profiling
- C/C++/D implementation
= version 2.1+
= version 3

Simulation engine
-----------------
All number crunching should be done lazy and potentially in another
task/process. Samplers should be able to be stoped, resumed, loaded
and saved.
