+ process.trajectory
- modified StochasticSimulationAlgorithm.__iter__ protocol
- add public API documentation
- regroup tests into specifications, unittests and bugs
- reorganize stocal/tests/test_examples.py
= release 2.0

OLD TODOs
- ensure that examples/validation is working
* stocal.algorithms.AndersonMethod.update_state is broken
+ support for proper delay events
- persistency support (save and resume simulations)
- arithmetic operations for Process
- string rewrite rule support
- other kinetic laws, e.g. Hill function
- libSBML integration
- curried reactions (determine products only upon application)
- performance measurements and profiling
- C/C++/D implementation
= version 2.1+
= version 3

Simulation engine
-----------------
All number crunching should be done lazy and potentially in another
task/process. Samplers should be able to be stoped, resumed, loaded
and saved.
