"""Chainable process samplers

WARNING: This module does currently not perform as described and is
scheduled to disappear in future versions.

This module is currently experimental. Its API might change without
notification, and there is no guarantee that it will be adopted by
the stable stocal core.

The samplers module provides a convenient framework to sample
stocal.Process instances. The framework is based on Sampler instances
that can be chained to customize the way a trajectory is sampled. The
simplest way to obtain a Sampler for a given process is to call the
processes sample method:

>>> sampler = process.sample(initial_state, tstart=0)

Process.sample is a factory method that selects and initializes an
appropriate stochastic simulation algorithm depending on the properties
of the given process.

The sampler obtained this way simply gives access to each iteration of
the algorithm: 

>>> for time, state, transitions in sampler:
>>>     print(time, state)

The yielded triple gives information of system time and state, plus
a dictionary that counts all transitions that occurred since the last
iteration (having only one key with value one in the above scenario).


All samplers expose methods that fine-tune the way a trajectory is
sampled. For example, to sample a trajectory until a given stop time
is reached, use:

>>> process.sample(initial_state).until(time=stop_time)

To sample only the first n steps, use:

>>> process.sample(initial_state).until(steps=n)

This will return samplers augmented with the given stop criteria.


By default, samplers yield one datapoint for each Transition generated
by the simulation algorithm. To only yield datapoints after m steps,
use:

>>> process.sample(initial_state).every(steps=m).until(steps=n)

or, to return a data point every dt time units, use:

>>> process.sample(initial_state).every(time=dt).until(steps=n)


Iterating over Sampler.every will yield the system state at the given
intervals. If you instead want to obtain the average system state over
the sampled interval, iterate over:

>>> process.sample(initial_state).average(steps=m)

or

>>> process.sample(initial_state).average(time=dt)

Now, the yielded state is the average state over the entire sampled
interval. In the first case, each state has the same weight in the
average. In the second case, states are weighed by the time they
occupied in the sampled interval.


To obtain data points only after certain Transition's have taken place,
use:

>>> process.sample(initial_state).filter([tran_a, trans_b, ...])


Note that the order in which Sampler's are chained is significant:

>>> process.sample(initial_state).average(steps=10).filter([trans])

will average the system states in blocks of ten and yield only those
blocks that feature trans.

>>> process.sample(initial_state).filter([trans]).average(steps=10)

in contrast, will take only system states ater each trans transition
and calculate averages of these states.

See the Sampler documentation for a full explanation of Sampler factory
methods.
