\maketitle{}

For each algorithm and model, figures show:
\begin{itemize}
\item on the left averaged trajectories of all system species over time
obtained by simulation (green) versus reported values from the DSMTS
repository (blue);

\item in the center the absolute standard error of sample averages
($\bar X_{t}$) from the reported mean ($\mu_{t}$) as a function of
sample size $N$:
\[
	\left|\frac{\bar X_{t}-\mu_{t}}{\sigma_{t}^{2}}\right| \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\right),
\]
where $\sigma_{t}$ is the reported standard deviation.
The red line ($3/\sqrt{N}$) is an upper bound for the error scaling
at three times the reported standard deviation and should be only
occasionally exceeded;

\item on the right the relative standard error between sampled
($\bar S_{t}^{2}$) and reported standard deviation ($\sigma_{t}^{2}$)
as a function of sample size:
\[
	\left|\frac{\bar S_{t}^{2}}{\sigma_{t}^{2}} - 1\right| \sim \mathcal{N}\left(0, \frac{2}{N}\right) .
\]
The red line ($5/\sqrt{N/2}$) is an upper bound for the error scaling
at five times the reported standard deviation and should be only
occasionally exceeded.
