<a name="installation"></a>
<h2>Download and Installation</h2>
The latest stable release of stocal is available from the python
package index:
<pre class="source">
&gt; pip install stocal
</pre>

The development version can be obtained from github
using the following commands:
<pre class="source">
&gt; git clone https://github.com/harfel/stocal.git
&gt; cd stocal
&gt; git checkout develop
&gt; sudo python setup.py install
</pre>

<a name="simple-example"></a>
<h2>A Simple Example</h2>
<p>We start by defining a simple stochastic process that describes the
reversible dimerization of two molecules of type A into a dimer A2.
Reactions are supposed to follow mass action kinetics.</p>

<p>To model this in stocal, we define two MassAction reactions,
one that transforms two A molecules into one molecule A2 with
stochastic rate constant 1.0, and one that transforms one molecule
of A2 into two A molecules with stochastic rate constant 10.0.
We then create a Process that groups these two reactions.</p>
<pre class="source">
&gt;&gt;&gt; from stocal import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; r1 = MassAction({'A': 2}, {'A2': 1}, 1.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; r2 = MassAction({'A2': 1}, {'A': 2}, 10.)
&gt;&gt;&gt; process = Process([r1, r2])
</pre>
We can use this process, to sample stochastic trajectories.
The method <tt>Process.trajectory</tt> instantiates a trajectory sampler
for a given initial condition and stop criterion.
The trajectory sampler implements the iterator protocol, so we can
simply iterate through the trajectory, invoking one stochastic transition
at a time. With each transition, time and state of the trajectory are
properly updated:
<pre class="source">
&gt;&gt;&gt; trajectory = process.trajectory({'A':100}, steps=1000)
&gt;&gt;&gt; for transition in trajectory :
...     print trajectory.time, trajectory.state['A'], trajectory.state['A2']
</pre>
This writes out the time and state of the first 1000 steps of the
stochastic trajectory as tab separated data.

<a name="reactions"></a>
<h2>Reactions</h2>
<p>Reactions such as MassActions above can either be invoked by
specifying reactant and product stoichiometries as dictionaries,
or as lists. If lists are used, the order of elements in the list is
irrelevant. There is no bound to the number of molecules that can
undergo a reaction. Reactants and products can also be empty to model
inflow into and outflow out of the system.</p>

<p>Propensities of reactions are calculated by multiplying the
stochastic rate constant with the number of potential reaction partners
in a given state. For reactions of up to three reactants, this reads:</p>
<table>
	<tr><th>Reactants</th><th>Propensity</th></tr>
	<tr><td>&mdash;</td><td>reaction.c</td></tr>
	<tr><td>A</td><td>reaction.c*state['A']</td></tr>
	<tr><td>A + B</td><td>reaction.c*state['A']*state['B']</td></tr>
	<tr><td>A + A</td><td>reaction.c*state['A']*(state['A']-1)/2.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>A + B + C</td><td>reaction.c*state['A']*state['B']*state['C']</td></tr>
	<tr><td>A + A + B</td><td>reaction.c*state['A']*(state['A']-1)*state['B']/2.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>A + A + A</td><td>reaction.c*state['A']*(state['A']-1)*(state['A']-2)/6.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In general, the propensity of a reaction is the stochastic rate
constant times the product of the binomial coefficients to choose
<i>n</i> reaction partners, <i>n</i> being the stoichiometry of the
reactant, out of <i>m</i> molecules, <i>m</i> being the copy number
of that reactant in the system state, for each reactant type.</p>
		
<a name="events"></a>
<h2>Events</h2>
stocal supports deterministic transitions that happen at a specific
time, either once or periodically with a given frequency.
<pre class="source">
&gt;&gt;&gt; feed = Event([], ['A'], 0.0, 1.0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; process = Process([r1, r2, feed])
</pre>
Here, the event <tt>feed</tt> will occur, and feed an A molecule to the
system, at time t=0.0 and then periodically every 1.0 time units.
Unlike stochastic reactions that occur with an average frequency,
nondeterministic events happen at exactly the specified times.


<a name="rules"></a>
<h2>Rule-Based Processes</h2>
<p>Having introduced an inflow, we next add an outflow to the model
that dilutes species proportional to their abundance. We could simply
add two reactions that remove molecules from the state:</p>
<pre class="source">
&gt;&gt;&gt; r4 = MassAction(['A'], [], 0.001)
&gt;&gt;&gt; r5 = MassAction(['A2'], [], 0.001)
</pre>
<p>However, this requires adding a dilution reaction for every chemical
in model. This might become cumbersome when dealing with many species,
and we might end up forgetting the dilution of one species or
another.</p>

<p>We take this scenario as a motivation to introduce rule-based
modelling. Rules can be thought of as patterns for reactions, rather
than specific reactions. As such, rules generate a whole set of
reactions.</p>

<p>Defining a rule requires to create a python class with some
required attributes and methods. The class needs to be derived from
<tt>ReactionRule</tt>, which requires our subclass to have the following
attributes:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>Transition:</dt>
	<dd>The type of Transition that the rule generates.
	Here, this is the <tt>MassAction</tt> type.</dd>
	<dt>novel_reactions:</dt>
	<dd>A method that generates an iterable of transitions for the given
	reactants.</dd>
</dl>
Taking this all together, we define the following Dilution rule:
<pre class="source">
class Dilution(ReactionRule) :
    Transition = MassAction

    def novel_reactions(self, species) :
        yield self.Transition([species], [], 0.001)
</pre>
Note the use of <tt>yield</tt> in the <tt>novel_reactions</tt> method.
This python keyword generates an on-the-fly iterable that contains all
yielded items. If <tt>yield</tt> is unfamiliar to you, you can instead
return a list of transitions without changing the behavior of the code:
<pre class="source">
    def novel_reactions(self, species) :
        return [ self.Transition([species], [], 0.001) ]
</pre>
	
Having defined a new rule, we can create a rule-based stochastic process
by giving a second argument the Process constructor:
<pre class="source">
process = Process([r1, r2, feed], [Dilution()])
</pre>
<p>Note here, that the second argument is a list of rule <i>instances</i>
rather than classes.</p>

<p>For clarity, <tt>Process</tt> allows its arguments to be named,
and we could have written the same processes instantiation as</p>
<pre class="source">
process = Process(transitions=[r1, r2, feed], rules=[Dilution()])
</pre>

<p>Let us look at a more interesting case and consider a system where
A molecules cannot only form dimers but polymers of any length.
Any two polymers&mdash;including monomers which are really just polymers
of length one&mdash;can come together to form a chain that joins these
two polymers.</p>

<p>To model this, we define a rule class for the polymerization that
generates a Polymerization reaction for any two reactants:</p>
<pre class="source">
class Polymerization(ReactionRule) :
    Transition = MassAction

    def novel_reactions(self, k, l) :
        yield self.Transition([k,l], [k+l], 10.)
</pre>
<p>This time, <tt>novel_reactions</tt> receives two reactants,
<tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> and yields a reaction that produces
their concatenation. This way, rules can create molecular species that
had not been previously in the system state!</p>

<p>To complete this example, we also generalize the reverse reactions
and define a Hydrolysis rule that breaks a polymer at any bond.
To make the model a little more interesting, we decide that the
stochastic rate constants of these reactions depends on the lengths
of the hydrolysis products, so that polymers are more likely to break
in the middle.</p>
<pre class="source">
class Hydrolysis(ReactionRule) :
    Transition = MassAction

    def novel_reactions(self, k) :
        for i in range(1, len(k)) :
            c = 10.*i*(len(k)-i)
            yield self.Transition([k], [k[:i], k[i:]], c)
</pre>
<p>This time our rule employs a <tt>for</tt> loop to generate several
reactions for each reactant&mdash;one for each potential breaking point
of the polymer.</p>

<p>The total stochastic process, including feeding, polymerization,
hybridization, and dilution is then defined by:</p>
<pre class="source">
process = Process(transitions=[feed], rules=[Dilution(), Polymerization(), Hydrolysis()])
</pre>
<p>Note that no change is necessary for the dilution rule, since it
already generates a reaction for every chemical in the system.</p>

<a name="complex-states"></a>
<h2>Complex States</h2>
<p>So far, all our molecular species have been character sequences, either
in the form of simple labels such as "A" and "A2", or in the form of
strings. However, stocal does not require chemicals to be strings. Any
imutable object can be used as a valid chemical species. Examples
would be tuples, frozensets, or custom python classes that define
a <tt>__hash__</tt> method and do not allow the user to alter the
state of an instance. This functionality is handy when modelling
chemistries that are more complex than simple molecules and polymers.</p>

<p>When defining custom classes to work with stocal, it is important
to properly implement what is called <i>structural congruence</i>.
Simply put, structurally congruent objects objects that are physically
identical (congruent) even though they might differ syntactically.</p>

<p>As a simple example, imagine we would like to model molecular
complexes, i.e. non-covalent associations of molecules. These are
important, for example, in molecular biology, where many proteins
form multi-protein complexes.</p>

<p>We could decide to model those complexes using tuples, where the
tuple items correspond to the individual components of the complex. For
example, the tuple <tt>('50S', '30S')</tt> could refer to the
complexified large and small subunit that constitute the ribosome.</p>

<p>However, tuples are ordered sequences in python, whereas molecular
complexes usually do not have a designated order of their components:
<tt>('50S', '30S')</tt> is really just the same as <tt>('30S', '50S')</tt>
and we need to teach this to python.</p>

<p>To do so, we defince a custom data type (class) that provides
an implementation of the equality operator <tt>__eq__</tt>
as well as the hash function <tt>__hash__</tt>. Since python does
not impose any semantics on customly defined operators, we also
have to define the inequality operator <tt>__ne__</tt>.</p>

<p>The simplest way to implement structural congruence is by means
of a normalization function that maps all congruent instances to
an identical representation. For our molecular complexes, we could
simply sort the tuple elements, thus making sure that differently
ordered complexes have the same normalization.</p>

<pre class="source">
class Complex(tuple) :
    @property
    def normalized(self) :
        return tuple(sorted(self))

    def __eq__(self, other) :
        return self.normalized == other.normalized

    def __ne__(self, other) :
        return not self==other

    def __hash__(self) :
        return hash(self.normalized)
</pre>

A complete implementation for molecular complexes might also overload
the plus operator <tt>__add__</tt> to make sure that adding to Complexes
generates a new Complex (since it would currently generate a tuple).

<a name="propensities"></a>
<h2>Propensities</h2>
<p>Rule-based stochastic processes bear a subtlety with regard to
propensities which does not appear in regular stochastic processes.
It is thus worthwhile to discuss propensity calculations in more
detail.</p>

<p>To illustrate the issue, we extend the above polymer example to work
with several types of monomers A and B, which can form polymers with
mixed content, such as ABBABAA. To achieve this, we simply need to
define another feed Event that provides monomers of the second type:</p>
<pre class="source">
process = Process(
    transitions=[
        Event({}, {'A': 1}, 0., 1.),
        Event({}, {'B': 1}, 0., 1.),
    ],
    rules=[Dilution(), Polymerization(), Hydrolysis()]
)
</pre>

<p>However, we need to decide what polymerization means and need to
slightly adapt the code of our model. A (linear) polymer is a chain
of interlinked polymers. Links could either be directional or
undirectional. Chemical examples of directional links are ester bonds,
peptide bonds, nucleic acid bonds, or any other bond where one can
clearly identify a left-hand and a right-hand side in the polymer.
Ether bonds, ketones and thiol bonds, on the other hand, are examples
of undirectional bonds, where the molecule is rotationally symmetric
along the binding site.</p>

<p>We have to decide whether our model features directional or
undirectional polymerization. Our choice will determine which
route we need to take to model polymerization accordingly.</p>

<p>In the case of directional bonds, two polymers <i>k</i> and <i>l</i>
can potentially form two different polymerization products: <i>k+l</i>
and <i>l+k</i>. Therefore, the polymerization rule has to generate
both reactions:</p>
<pre class="source">
class Polymerization(ReactionRule) :
    Transition = MassAction

    def novel_reactions(self, k, l) :
        yield self.Transition([k,l], [k+l], 5.)
        yield self.Transition([k,l], [l+k], 5.)
</pre>
<p>If <tt>k</tt> and <tt>l</tt> are different and if <tt>k+l</tt>
is different from <tt>l+k</tt>, this yields two reactions with
propensities 5<i>n</i><sub>k</sub>n</i><sub>l</sub> each. If, however,
<tt>k</tt> equals <tt>l</tt>, the generated reactions are identical,
each one with propensity 5/2n</i><sub>k</sub>(n</i><sub>k</sub>-1),
where the factor 1/2 comes from the binomial coefficent discussed in
the section on <a href="#reactions">Reactions</a>.
It is also possible for <tt>k</tt> and <tt>l</tt> to be different,
but yet, for the reaction products <tt>k+l</tt> and <tt>l+k</tt> to be
identical&mdash;or more precisely, structurally congruent. An example
would be the molecules AB and ABAB which form the polymer ABABAB no
matter which way around they bind. Since reactant and product lists in
the Transition constructor are unordered lists, the two generated
reactions would also be identical, each with propensity
5*<i>n</i><sub>k</sub>n</i><sub>l</sub>.</p>

<p>Stocal properly detects the multiplicity of reactions, and assigns
to each generated reaction a total propensity that sums up the
propensities from individually generated reactions. In the example,
this implies that any &quot;left&quot; polymer will bind any
&quot;right&quot; polymer with about the same propensity, no matter
whether the two reactants are equal or not. However, if the two
possible polymerization products are indistinguishable, they will
be produced with a doubled propensity.</p>

<p>In the case of undirectional bonds, we only have to infer the
original one reaction, but we have to assert that <i>k+l</i> and
<i>l+k</i> are structurally congruent. As we have seen before, this
is best done by defining a custom type for undirectional polymers:</p>
<pre class="source">
class Polymer(str) :
    @property
    def normalized(self) :
        return min(self, ''.join(reversed(self)))
</pre>
<p>with the above overloads for <tt>__eq__</tt>, <tt>__ne__</tt> and
<tt>__hash__</tt>. The undirectional Polymerization rule now becomes:</p>
<pre class="source">
class Polymerization(ReactionRule) :
    Transition = MassAction

    def novel_reactions(self, k, l) :
        yield self.Transition([k,l], [Polymer(k+l)], 10.)
</pre>
<p>In this case, propensities are calculated as in the standard
Gillespie algorithm, where the propensity of a reaction with
dinstinguishable partners is twice as big as the propensity of
reactions with indistinguishable partners.</p>

<p>In summary, when modelling chemistries in stocal, the user does
not need to bother about calculating propensities, as this is
dealt with by the framework. In contrast, what the user has to
pay attention to is that the textual representation of molecules
properly captures the physical aspects of the modelled chemistry,
i.e. define proper structural congruence relations.</p>
